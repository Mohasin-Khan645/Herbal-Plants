Getting Started
1. Place in a static server (VS Code Live Server or any HTTP server).
2. Add images under `images/`: `logo.png`, `banner.jpg`, `tulsi.jpg`, `neem.jpg`, `aloe.jpg` (and others).
3. Put your Gemini API key in `js/utils.js` at `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
4. Open `index.html` in a browser (preferably via http://).

Notes
- Without an API key, AI features will show a friendly disabled message.
- To simulate diseases, name test images with keywords like `powdery`, `mildew`, `brown-spots`, `rust`, `blight`.
- Data can be expanded by adding entries to `data/plants.json` and `data/diseases.json`.

Future Ideas
- TensorFlow.js for actual image classification.
- Firebase Auth + Firestore for community sharing and saved data.
- Weather API for climate-based care tips.
